Image Denoising Using DnCNN
Overview
This project focuses on image denoising using the DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) model. The implementation involves MATLAB-based applications and pre-trained models to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in removing noise from images.

How to Use
MATLAB Implementation

Open Pre_trained_Model_DnCNN_Code.m in MATLAB.
Load a noisy image (e.g., Doge.jpeg or Grey Cameraman.jpg).
Run the script to apply the denoising model.
View the results and compare with the original image.
GUI Application

Open the MATLAB App Designer file.
Use the GUI to upload a noisy image and apply denoising.
Requirements
MATLAB (with Deep Learning Toolbox)
Pre-trained DnCNN model
Image Processing Toolbox (optional)
Results
The project successfully demonstrates how deep learning-based denoising techniques outperform traditional methods in removing noise while preserving image details.
